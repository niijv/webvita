Web-Vita and Publishing App 
=========

A minimal framework for a searchable personal blog site and online CV based on Flask. 

This application is designed to be hosted on OpenShift (url). 

Nevertheless, the postgres database can easily be replaced with sqlite3 and then be hosted on pytonanywhere.com or some other cloud-hosting service, if that is more your style.

Dependencies
=========

* Flask
* Flask-SQLAlchemy

For detailed dependencies see setup.py.
